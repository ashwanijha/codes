New code to calculate PCC from tab separated file which also gives P-value for correlation coefficient. This program uses java guava (https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/Release22) library and Apache Commons Math (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/download_math.cgi) library. Great work guys and thanks for these lovely libraries. 

match.java to match two files based on any columns in the code the lines in files were matched by column "zero" which serve as key to hasharray. This program uses java guava (https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/Release22) library. Match can be done by changing the multimap at line 34 data.put(a[0], str) to data.put(a[anycol], str). 



Please drop an e-mail @ ashwanijha.bioinfo@gmail.com if you want help regarding these codes as well as you can ask for help with your own code and algorithm.

Cheers
